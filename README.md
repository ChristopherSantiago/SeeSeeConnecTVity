# Facial Recognition.



Real time face recognition is part of the field of biometrics. Biometrics is  the  ability for a computer to  recognize a human through a unique physical trait. Face recognition provides the capability  for  the  computer  to  recognize  a  human  by  facial characteristics. Today, biometrics is one of the fastest growing fields  in  advanced  technology.  Predictions  indicate  a biometrics  explosion  in  the  next  century,  to  authenticate identities  and  avoid  and  unauthorized  access  to  networks, database and facilities. A facial recognition device is a  device  that takes an  image or  a  video  of  a human  face  and  compares  it  to other  image faces in a database. The structure, shape and proportions of the faces  are  compared  during  the  face  recognition  steps.  In addition,  distance  between  the  eyes,  nose,  mouth  and  jaw, upper  outlines  of  the  eye  sockets,  the  sides  of  the  mouth, location  of  the  nose  and  eyes,  and  the  area  surrounding  the check bones are also compared. When  using  a  facial  recognition  program,  several pictures of  the  person  must  be  taken  at  different  angles  and  with different  facial  expressions . At  time  of  verification  and identification the subject stands in front of the camera for a few seconds,  and  then  the  image  is  compared  to  those  that  have been previously recorded. Facial  recognition  is  widely  used  because  of  its  benefits. The advantages of facial recognition are that it.
